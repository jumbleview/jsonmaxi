# jsonmaxi #
Tiny project to provide indentation to the  json fragment using clipboard as both:
source and destination. Normally it is used in such a way:
1. File containing json objects opened by some editor or viewer.
2. Compressed json fragment is selected and copied into clipboard.
3. Executable "jsonmaxi" is invoked (normally as some editor extension or plugin).
4. Content of clipboard by "paste" operation put into some fresh editor/viewer 
window or buffer for inspection.
